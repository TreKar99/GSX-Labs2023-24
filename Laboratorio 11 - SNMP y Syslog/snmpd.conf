# SECTION: System Information Setup
#

# syslocation: The [typically physical] location of the system.
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysLocation.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  location_string
sysLocation    Sitting on the desktop of my house
sysContact     German

# sysservices: The proper value for the sysServices object.
#   arguments:  sysservices_number
sysServices    72

# SECTION: Agent Operating Mode
#
#   This section defines how the agent will operate when it
#   is running.

# master: Should the agent operate as a master agent or not.
#   Currently, the only supported master agent type for this token
#   is "agentx".
#   
#   arguments: (on|yes|agentx|all|off|no)

master  agentx

# agentaddress: The IP address and port number that the agent will listen on.
#   By default the agent listens to any and all traffic from any
#   interface on the default SNMP port (161).  This allows you to
#   specify which address, interface, transport type and port(s) that you
#   want the agent to listen on.  Multiple definitions of this token
#   are concatenated together (using ':'s).
#   arguments: [transport:]port[@interface/address],...

#agentaddress  127.0.0.1,[::1]
agentAddress udp:161
